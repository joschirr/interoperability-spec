Some components (tools) will produce and consume files. To reduce mismatches and help to properly handle the files,
the following properties/features about the `file formats` are relevant (to attach to the description of the
inputs/outputs that use `file`) :

|===
|Feature | Strength | Description

|id | required | identify the format

|label | optional | label or name to display

|mimeType | optional | mimeType as described in the metadata (e.g., ms:mimeType).

|encoding | optional | identify the character encoding as described in the metadata (e.g., ms:characterEncoding)

|parents | optional | formats from which this format is derived from, that allows to maintain a hierarchy of the
formats. (Galaxy administrators do manage data types based on a hierarchy of formats)

|doc_url | optional | link to the complete documentation provided in metadata (e.g., ms:documentationURL)
|===

The features are normally present in the metadata (e.g., ms:dataFormat) and in the embedded annotations (e.g.,
java annotations). To simplify, we can suppose that `id` is the only required element, even if all may be important
for the users (e.g., to identify a specific file), the developers (e.g., to understand a file for implementation) or
tools (e.g., to automatically process a file).
