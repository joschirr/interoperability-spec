This requirement can be fulfilled with implementation of requirement 75. However, it is common that components take a
model as input parameter (for instance in the case of DKPro Core) and hence the languages supported by the component
are determined by the available models. In such cases language information can not be encoded in the component metadata.
One option is to implement a functionality in the registry to look up available models for each component and update
the component language capabilities based on the modelâ€™s language. This function can be triggered every time a new
model is added to the registry.

| ARGO
| 0.5
| Partial
| Argo components can embed language metadata in their UIMA XML descriptors, however most components do not declare this information.
| Draft

| DKPro Core
| 1.8.0
| Partial
| Most DKPro Core components use language-specific models. It is impossible to know the full set up models for a component as new models can be created by users at any time. For those components where the language support is hard-coded (i.e. not determined by the model used), the component ususally bears language metadata in the form of a uimaFIT LanguageCapability annotation which translates into a language capability declaration in the component's UIMA descriptor.
