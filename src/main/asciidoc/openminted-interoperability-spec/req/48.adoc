[small]#*_Status:_* __deprecated__#

NOTE: Deprecated because this is a requirement on each metadata schema rather than the actual resources 

All resource metadata records must include a reference to the metadata schema used for their description. 

NOTE: for provenance information, we need to know the metadata schema from which we are extracting/converting information.
