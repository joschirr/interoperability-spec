Compression algorithms are used to reduce the size of data. To avoid problems in working with such
data (creating or consuming), only algorithms/formats should be used for which there is broad 
support across platforms and programming languages. There are:

* gzip (also known as gz)
* zip
* xz
* tar (including tar.gz)

Specifically to be avoided are commercial algorithms and their implementations, e.g.

* rar
