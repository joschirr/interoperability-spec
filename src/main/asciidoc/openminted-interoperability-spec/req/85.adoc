The OMTD-SHARE schema includes specific distinct metadata elements for identifier and version of all resources.
More specifically:

|====
|Name|Element/Attribute|Type|Strength|Repeatability|Description

|identifier
|element
|xs:string
|mandatory
|yes
|Reference to a PID, DOI or any kind of identifier used by the resource provider for the resource; must obligatorily be used with the attribute _resourceIdentifierSchemeName_

|resourceIdentifierSchemeName
|attribute
|open controlled vocabulary
|mandatory
|no
|Reference to the resource scheme that has been used for the identifier (e.g. DOI, handle etc.); the list of values includes the most widespread schemes used for resources

|schemeURI
|attribute
|URI
|mandatory when applicable
|no
|Reference to a URI of the resource scheme that has been used for the identifier, providing more information about the resource scheme

|version
|attribute
|xs:string
|recommended
|no
|Any string, usually a number, that identifies the version of a resource
|====

Components that already include an identifier and version from previous metadata records can map them to these elements. 

NOTE: For components collected from Maven, the Maven id (groupId, artifactId, versionId) can be used with a reference
to the Maven scheme (i.e. use the attribute _schemeURI_ with the value"https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Maven_Coordinates").

NOTE: There is an ongoing discussion about a unique Persistent Identifier (PID) and the procedure for assigning it which may lead to further specifications.
