| via @TypeCapability tags and also sometimes declared as javadoc. Mind that some components cannot clearly state the
supported inputs/outputs until they actually process a document and have loaded the necessary models/rules. It may also
be the case that despite declaring a certain input, the component may work without it or that despite declaring a certain
output, the component may not actually produce it (e.g. because the user disabled the creation of the output or because
a document simply contains no instance of the specific type)

| GATE

| No
| GATE components do not specify any information regarding their input and output, mostly as there is no defined type system in GATE. Essentially we use the document as a blackboard so the input and output is the document with extra information added to it in the form of annotations and/or features, but each component is free to use that blackboard as they wish.
