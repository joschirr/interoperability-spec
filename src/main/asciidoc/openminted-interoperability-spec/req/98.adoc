In order to make components downloadable, they must be published either via a Maven repository or
via a Docker repository. The respective repositories used should be Maven Central and DockerHub as
these are by default supported by related tooling.

The process of publishing software via Maven Central is detailed in the link:http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html[OSSRH Guide].

The process of publishing software via DockerHub is detailed link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockerrepos/[here].
